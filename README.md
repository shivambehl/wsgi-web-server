# wsgi-web-server

This is a 'Basic' implementation of an HTTP WSGI web server. It can be used to run python web development frameworks like Flask, Django, pyramid, web2py etc.
Pythons socket library is used for this project.

I lay stress on Basic because in now way it is production ready. It is just a barebones prototypes and lacks some important functionalities.

I made this as to get better understanding of the technology, and maybe will add few more features soon.

If you got any feedback, do tell me. It will be appreciated.
