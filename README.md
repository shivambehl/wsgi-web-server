# wsgi-web-server

This is a 'Basic' implementation of an HTTP WSGI web server. It can be used to run webapps based on python's web development frameworks like Flask, Django, pyramid, web2py etc.
Python's socket library is used for this project.

I laid stress on word 'Basic' because in no way this is production ready. It is just a barebones prototype and lacks some important functionalities.

I made this as to get better understanding of the technology, and maybe will add few more features soon.

Any feedback will be appreciated.
